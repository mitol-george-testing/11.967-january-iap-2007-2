It introduces analytical tools that are used to assess local economic development conditions, issues, and opportunities as part of formulating economic development plans. The course is designed to provide MCP students with skills needed for applied economic development planning work in other courses, particularly Economic Development Planning (11.438) and Revitalizing Urban Main Streets ([11.439](courses/11-439-revitalizing-urban-main-streets-hyde-jackson-square-roslindale-square-boston-spring-2005)).\n",
